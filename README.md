## Installation
Please refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET/blob/master/Documentation/Installation_Guide.txt).

## User Manual
The user guide for version 2 can be found in both [PDF](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET/blob/master/Documentation/JET_2.0_UserManual.pdf) and in [PowerPoint](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET/blob/master/Documentation/JET_2.0_UserManual.pptx). The **most comprehensive** details can be found in the [Technical White Paper](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET/blob/master/Documentation/JET_2.0_TechnicalWhitePaper.pdf).

The white paper for version 1 is archived [here](https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET/blob/master/Archive/JET_1.0_TechnicalWhitePaper.pdf).

## Academic Use and Proper Citation
When JET is used in publications, proper reference to the following papers and this software should be made. (**Paper + doi of this software.**)
An article describing the JET toolbox is under preparation. It will be the most proper paper to cite once available.
For now please cite these papers partially describing the method used in the toolbox instead.
