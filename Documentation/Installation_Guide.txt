1. Go to a convenient location in your computer.
Please note that for most operating systems it is advisable to make sure the directory is not too long, does not contain spaces or non-English characters.

2. Clone from GitHub repository.
git clone https://github.com/SAIL-GuoLab/JET

3. Organize your data inside “./Data/” folder, in the following hierarchy: ./Data/vender/scanner/study/session/

4. Modify and run JET_main_script.m

5. In order to protect intellectual property as well as to insure that programs run as intended, most Matlab code files have been encrypted to .p files.
When encountering software bugs please file a report to jg3400@columbia.edu.

6. This toolbox is still under further development. Newly-found bugs will be fixed and more functionalities will be implemented in Version 3.0.

7. When JET is used in publications, proper reference to the above cited papers should be made. (Paper + doi of this software.)
An article describing the JET toolbox is under preparation. It will be the most proper paper to cite once available.
For now please cite these papers partially describing the method used in the toolbox instead.
